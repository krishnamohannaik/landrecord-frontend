## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

cd landrecord-frontend
````

> Make sure you're in the `myproject` folder where `manage.py` and `requirements.txt` are located.

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
```

---

### 4. Create `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the `myproject` directory. Example:

```ini

## ⚠️ Security Notes

* Do **not** share your `.env` file publicly.
